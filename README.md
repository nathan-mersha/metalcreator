Steel alloy property simulator

  The software simulates the properties of different alloys of steel based on the initial composition, cooling rate, other mixed existing elements. The GUI is designed to be user friendly,in that the Material Engineer can easily compute the properties of different points and different scenarios and can compare the result with one another. 
  
  The calculated properties are : 
>  * Enthalpy
>  * Density 
>  * Thermal Conductivity
>  * Liquid Viscosity
>  * Surface Tension
>  * Solid/Liquid Interface Energy
>  * Secondary Dendrite Arm spacing,
>  * Austenite Grain Size and total consumed energy in producing a gram. 
  
  The mathematics for these simulations are to be implemented from a paper: 
> * Written by: J. Miettinen 
> * Titled    : IDS Thermodynamic–kinetic–empirical tool for modeling of solidification, micro structure and material     properties.
